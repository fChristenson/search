# Search

Any search needs 2 parts to work, data and a search algorithm.
Getting data can be done in many ways:

* Google has web crawlers to index webpages
* Companies have employees
* Social media has users
* Scientists have instruments

The type and size of the data is what determines what type
of search solution will be a good fit.
Different needs require different search algorithms.

## The big problem with creating relevance in a search

Because every person searching for something is different the algorithm can only
do so much to figure out what is more relevant than something else.
Counting words will not be enough.

In order to get the most relevant content to the user search engine
companies try to gather data about you to create a profile.

This means that in order for the search algorithm to be good
your data indexing must be good and the profiling of your users
needs to be excellent.

As you can imagine the problem grows BIG very quickly.
